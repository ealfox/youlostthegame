# youlostthegame

A very simple game made as a birthday present for my sister. My first project using pygame that I made completely alone so please don't kill me if you find out it's totally wrong :D
 </br> You can do whatever you want with the code (but probably better don't even look at it, I tried not to create a total mess but...), just please don't use the images anywhere without credit, I made them for this game and would prefer if they were used for this purpose only.</br>
All the files used in the game are in the zip file. The one I didn't upload separately is the font file but you can find it there. There's also an executable file but keep in mind it works on 64-bit Windows only. </br></br>
I know there are loads of mistakes and stuff to improve but I had limited time to do this and I'm seriously just glad it works haha :D Anyway, thanks for stopping by.
